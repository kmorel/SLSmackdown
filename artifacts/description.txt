This directory simply captures artifacts like timing logs produced by the
experiments and used to create the charts in the paper.


composite-order: Experiments run to compare the performance differences for
the composite-composite improvements and the composite ordering in
radix-k.

SMP mode.  Transparent images were generated.

composite-order/intrepid-2048-smp.csv: Runs on Intrepid using 2048 nodes in
SMP mode.  Transparent images were generated.

This directory simply captures artifacts like timing logs produced by the
experiments and used to create the charts in the paper.


composite-order: Experiments run to compare the performance differences for
the composite-composite improvements and the composite ordering in
radix-k.

composite-order/intrepid-0256-smp.csv: Runs on Intrepid using 256 nodes in
SMP mode.  Transparent images were generated.

composite-order/intrepid-2048-smp.csv: Runs on Intrepid using 2048 nodes in
SMP mode.  Transparent images were generated.


interlacing: Experiments run to compare the performance with and without
image interlacing.

interlacing/intrepid-interlace-smp.csv: Runs on Intrepid in SMP mode.
Transparent images were generated.

interlacing/interlace.clog2,no-interlace.clog2: Jumpshot logs for running
with and without interlacing.  These runs were independent of those
measured in intrepid-interlace-smp.csv.  Runs on Intrepid with 64 nodes in
SMP mode.  Transparent 2K^2 images were generated.


telescoping: Experiments run to compare the performance of folded binary
swap and regular radix-k to their telescoped counterparts.

telescoping/telescope-interepid-smp.csv.bz2: Runs on Intrepid up to 2048
nodes/processes in SMP mode.

telescoping/telescope-intrepid-vn.csv.bz2: Runs on Intrepid up to 2048 nodes,
8192 processes in VN mode.


scaling: Experiments run to test scaling of IceT on Intrepid.

scaling/scaling-intrepid-vn.csv: Runs on Intrepid up to 8192 nodes, 32768
processes in VN mode.
